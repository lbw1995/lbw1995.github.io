## Research Experiences
### Application of Deep Learning in the Prediction of Interaction between Promoters and Enhancers (2021-now)
1. Use transformer based deep neural network to predict whether specific Promoters and Enhancers have interactions.
2. Explore which motifs are important for the interactions between promoters and enhancers.
### Analyzing Temporal Sequencing Data with Deep Learning (2020-2020)
1. Extracting main features from data at each time. 
2. Implementing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with python to train the model.
3. Prediction and correction of sequencing data.
### Big Data Computing Platform for Bioinformatics (2018-2019)
1. Built Hadoop Spark big data computing clusters to data processing and storage.
2. Used Multithread Technology and TCP socket with Java to collect sequencing data and exchange messages with computing clusters.
3. Received data by Spark Streaming and processed data by Spark MLlib with Scala.
### A Normal-free Method for Microsatellites Instability Evaluation (2018-2019)
1. Model data of each feature with Polynomial distribution.
2. Learn parameters of each feature and select features with these parameters.
3. Comparing the features of tumor samples with those of normal samples and detect the status of the microsatellites instability.
### Estimating Tumor Purity Using Tumor-only DNA Methylation Data (2018-2019)
1. Selecting stable features from normal samples and fitting parameters.
2. Compare tumor sample with the former parameters on stable features and calculate the differences.
3. Using Beta Mixture Model to model these differences and using Bayesian Estimation of Beta Mixture Models with Variational Inference (VIBMM) to detect cluster adaptively.
4. Calculate tumor purity using clustering results.
